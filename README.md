# RetroTINK 5X SCART Dock

Mike Chi's [RetroTINK 5X Pro](https://www.retrotink.com/product-page/5x-pro) is a blessing to the entire retro-gaming community. However the SCART port on the 5X has its issue, not to mention that nobody has any love left for the SCART standard itself. Personally, I'm also a fan of vertical stands for my devices. So here's my approach to tackle the matters.

This dock system puts the RetroTINK 5X into a vertical standing position. It taps into the SCART port, so RGBS + audio signals could be fed into the 5X, while providing extra stability.

There are two version of the dock. One that uses the standard BNC and 3.5mm audio headers, and the other that makes use of my [VGA RGBS + audio pinout standard](https://github.com/jeffqchen/Console-VGA-Dongle-Series).
